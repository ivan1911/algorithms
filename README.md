**[dijkstra.py](https://github.com/ivan1911/algorithms/blob/master/dijkstra.py)** - Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by Dutch [computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm) in 1956 and published in 1959,[1][2] is a [graph search algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_search_algorithm) that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.
